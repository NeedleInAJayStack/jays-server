This contains terraform configuration.

## Getting Started

Note that to get the terraform state, you must have the `aws` cli working locally. To do so:

1. [Download and install the cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) 
2. Run `aws configure` and use an access token (find existing one in BitWarden)
3. If a new access token must be created, you can do so in [AWS IAM](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/users/details/Jay?section=security_credentials)
